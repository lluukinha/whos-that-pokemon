# Who's That Pokemon?

Demo: https://lluukinha.github.io/whos-that-pokemon/dist/

I created a simple `Who's that pokemon` game using VueJs only based on [this project](https://github.com/raraujo91/whos-that-pokemon) i saw from a friend from facebook using React.

The pokemon list Json is a file I created for use in another projects, that's why it has informations about the type, description, next evolutin, etc...
The Json is in portuguese (PT-BR) but everything else is coded in English.

##### Why do I use Pokemon data in almost every project?
  - a lot of people already know at least the 151 from first generation
  - big database
  - nostalgic

##### I dont have any rights. Pokémon and  Pokémon character names are trademarks of Nintendo.
